A major mode for Emacs providing really BASIC syntax highlight for
po files using Treesitter.

Please note this provides very basic functionality. If you're looking
for a fully featured mature mode, please consider [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/po-mode/][po-mode]].


** Install

This package is available on MELPA. If you already have it set, add to your ~init.el~ file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package po-ts-mode
    :mode ("\\.po\\'" . po-ts-mode)
    :defer 't)
#+END_SRC


** Don't skip this
Before using it, be sure you have BOTH ~po~ grammars installed.
